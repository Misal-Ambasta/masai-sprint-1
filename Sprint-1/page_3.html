For us, we consider the three main ones  We’ll walk through the main characteristics of each and start to break down sub-categories.
         <ul>
           <li> Handgun</li>
           <li>Rifle </li>
           <li> Shotgun </li></p>

        <h2>Handgun<br></h2><br>
        We will be using “pistol” and “handgun” to mean the same thing.  When you start combining federal and general state law, a handgun has the following characteristics:
        <ul>
          <li>Fired from one hand</li>
          <li>No support from the shoulder</li>
          <li>Barrel length of under 16 inches</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Revolvers</h2>

A revolver is also a handgun, but the chamber is not permanently integrated or in line with the barrel. Instead, cartridges are stored in chambers bored into a cylinder and rotated into alignment with the barrel as needed.

        <h2>Rifle</h2><br>
        
        A rifle usually has the following characteristics:
        
        <ul>
          <li>Fired with two hands</li>
          <li>Braced against the shoulder</li>
          <li>Fires only one projectile with each pull of the trigger</li>
          <li>Barrel has rifling which helps spin and stabilize the bullet</li>
          <li>Barrel length of over 16 inches</li>
        </ul>
          
          We’ll be breaking down rifles into two subsets—bolt action and semi-automatic.  Popular bolt actions include the Remington 700 series, while the two most popular semi’s are the AR-15 and AK-47.

          <h2>Shotguns</h2><br><br>
          Shotguns have smooth barrels to fire a variety of different ammunition.  The most common ammo involves lots of metal pellets which spread out.  The mishmash of federal and state laws show shotguns to have:
          
          <ul>
            <li>Fired with two hands while braced against the shoulder</li>
            <li>Fires once per pull of the trigger</li>
            <li>Smooth barrel</li>
            <li>Barrel length of over 18 inches</li>
                       
          </ul>
